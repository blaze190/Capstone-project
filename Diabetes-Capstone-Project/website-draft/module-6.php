              <p class="text-light">Hypoglycaemia – also called a hypo – is the medical word for low blood glucose levels. BSLs below 4mmol/L are considered low.
			  A hypo means there is not enough glucose in your blood. This means your brain and other organs can’t get energy when needed. This can be very dangerous.
			  Hyperglycemia is the medical term for high blood glucose levels. Blood levels above 7mmol/L are considered high. 
			  All young adults with diabetes have some blood glucose levels above the target range. This is not a problem if the majority are within the target range
			  It is possible for your blood sugar level to be high without you realising. 
			Many people do not feel sick until their blood sugar levels are extremely high (above 15mmol/L).

          <p class="">When do I use Insulin? <br>
			What does a hypo feel like? Everyone feels different when having a hypo. Some common signs include feeling: Sweaty, Shaky, Sleepy, Cross, Weak, Like it's hard to concentrate, Have a headache, Emotional, 
			What can cause a hypo?
			Too much insulin, Not eating enough carbohydrates, Skipping meals, Exercise or sport, Stress or anxiety.
			Sometimes you can have a hypo for no reason at all!
			Common times for hypos are just before lunch and during and after sport. They can also happen during the night if your blood sugar is too low before you go to bed.
			<br>What should I do if I think I’m having a hypo?
			If you feel like you are having a hypo, the first thing you should do is always eat or drink something sweet. Appropriate sweet foods are fast acting carbohydrates, such as:
			½ glass of fruit juice, cordial or soft drink;
			4 large or 7 small jelly beans;
			3 teaspoons honey or sugar;
			<br>The second thing you need to do is check your BSL. If you are having a hypo it will be below 4.
			After 15 minutes, you should have a long-acting carbohydrate to stop the hypo from coming back, like:
			A piece of fruit, 
			A slice of bread,
			Two biscuits, or
			A glass of milk.
			<br>
			Finally, it is important to check your BSL a second time 15-30mins later. It should be improving. If hypoglycaemia is left untreated or does not improve you may fall asleep or have a fit.

          <p class=""> What might I feel like when my blood sugar is too high?
			<br>Some of the signs include feeling:
			Feeling excessively thirsty, Frequently needing to wee, Feeling tired, Blurred vision, Weight loss, Hunger, Mood changes.
			<br>What can cause high BSLs; Ilness; Infection; Stress, worry and anxiety; Too many carbohydrates at once; Not enough insulin; Less exercise than usual
			<br>What short-term problems can occur with hyperglycaemia? If hyperglycemia is left untreated ketoacidosis may develop. Ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious condition associated with illness or very high blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetes. 
			It develops gradually over hours or days. It is a sign of insufficient insulin. 
			Without enough insulin, the body’s cells cannot use glucose for energy. To make up for this, the body begins to burn fat for energy instead.
			This leads to accumulation of dangerous chemical substances in the blood called ketones, which also appear in the urine.
			<br>Signs of DKA include: rapid breathing, flushed cheeks, abdominal pain, vomiting and dehydration. </p>

			<br>What long-term problems can occur with hyperglycaemia?
			<br>When blood glucose is too high too often, it can harm blood vessels and cause heart attacks. It can also damage organs in the body and cause blindness, kidney failure, or loss of toes or feet.
			<br>What do I do if my blood sugar is too high?
			<br>If your blood sugar is too high, you need to lower it by adjusting the amount of insulin you take with your next meal. You also should drink plenty of fluids because hyperglycaemia can make you dehydrated. 
			<br>If your blood sugar is very high (above 15mmol/L) you need to check for ketones as well. You can do this by testing your urine with strips, or by using a special glucometer with a drop of blood. 
			<br>If you have lots of ketones in your urine (above 1.5mmol/L), you are in the early stages of DKA. You need to call your diabetes educator to work out how much extra insulin you need to take. 
			<br>If you don’t have lots of ketones, keep checking your BSL and ketones every 2 hours until your BSL is below 7. Do not exercise if your BSL is above 15mmol/L or ketones are present.
